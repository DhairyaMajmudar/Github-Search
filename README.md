## About Github Searcher

Github Searcher is a web apllication from which user can find the information of other github users just by searching their username.

Rather using traditional REST API the application uses the power of GraphQl Query to fetch only the required information from the API which results in decreased use of bandwidth and increasing the performance.

Other than that being built on the top of Nextjs makes application server side, using tailwind for styling makes the website to look more modular and user friendly.

Type saftey is taken utmost care with the help of TypeScript resulting in decreased number of bugs.
